# Java &mdash; Advanced Concepts

Implementation of advanced concepts of Java. Doesn't contain the basics of Java programming. I've made this repository for my personal reference/practice, feel free to refer to this repository and/or contribute to the repository. I'm very active on GitHub where I make repositories like this as my programming notes/revision.

**NOTE**: This repository might not contain all the advanced concepts in Java. It will only contain concepts that I presume are important in Java that are uniquely available only in Java (or) specific to Java (or) if the implementation of the concept might be different in Java.
